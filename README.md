# This is the project of CS5483.

## Main information
- Title: Classification for Human Activity Based on time series data
- Data source:Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones

## Content
This project can be divided 4 part.
- Part1: data analysis
  
  The code is in code/Data analysis
- Part2: data preprocessing
  
  The code is in code/preprocessing_kmeans
- Part3: classification
 
  We use KNN, SVM, RandomForest and CNN. cross-validation, hyperparameters, and other methods are used to select suitable parameters for models. Various evaluation methods also are used to evaluate the performance of model.
- Part4: clustering
  
  We use kmeans, DBSCAN and OPTICS to cluster.




## other part includes PPT, report and relavent paper.
